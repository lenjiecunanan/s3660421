    <p class="personal"> In records, I'm <i> "Lenjie" </i>, anywhere else however, I am more known by my second name <b> “Catherine” </b>. I am currently in the last semester of my degree, Bachelor’s of Human Resources Management. I have been studying in RMIT for 3 and half years now, which in between I took a gap year. </p>

    <p> I have been living here in Australia for 5 years now. My background is Filipino with Spanish ancestors. However, I do not speak or know Spanish language more than the small list of terms that we have adapted to suit our day to day dialect in the Philippines. </p>

    <p>Interesting fact about me is that I have 3 cats and a dog that all get along well with each other. I also play a fair amount of board games - few of my favourites are <strong> Catan, Carcassonne and King of Tokyo </strong>.</p>

    <h2>INTEREST IN I.T.</h2>

      <p> My interest in IT revolves around more on the general functionality side of it. I am more interested in how it helps perform the day to day tasks of non IT employees. 
I developed an interest in IT when I met my stepdad, he is a Solutions Architect in a global IT company that is based here in Melbourne. Whenever he talks about his job I could see there’s so much passion in his eyes which has inspired me and led me to studying Computer Science back in the Philippines. However, when I came here I developed more interest in business which is why I pursued my course now. 
 </p>

<p> By saying that, I also realised how IT has shaped and became part of our daily chores and activities in life. It is quite impossible to determine tasks we perform that do not involve IT. In business particularly in HR, IT is such an essential part of completing tasks efficiently. IT plays a large role in communication, storing and gathering data, as well as analysing it. HR is becoming more and more a consumer of IT. </p>

<p> This is why I enrolled in this course in hopes to have a better understanding of IT and be prepared for the future phase of the workplace. </p>

          <p>  <a href="https://123psychology.com/quiz/test-1-myers-briggs-extravert-or-introvert/"> Link for Myers and Briggs Personality test.</a> </p>
           <p> <a href="https://123psychology.com/personality-types-istj-isfj-estj-esfj/4/"> My Personality Results.</a> </p>

<p> From Myer and Briggs personality test, I achieved the result of being (EJST) <b> Extrovert </b>, <b> Sensor </b>, <b> Thinker </b> and a <b> Judger </b>. <br>
According to Myers and Briggs <b> ESTJs </b> in a nutshell are: <br>
<ul>
<li> naturals when it comes to organizing </li>

<li> level-headed, articulate and direct </li>  

<li> have strong personalities </li>

<li> Their life-philosophy could be described as: <i> What I show you, is what I am </i>. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I could never disagree to any of these. I am always described by some of my friends as someone of result-orientated, organized, social and have an outspoken opinion.<br>
I am the one who always organises any gatherings or outings we have, either with family or friends. I get really annoyed when someone else organises it and does not take not of the weather.<br>
And similarly, my life-philosophy is "<i>What you see,  is what you get </i>!" <br>
The test results accurately describes my personality.
