    <p class="personal"> In records, I'm <i> "Lenjie" </i>, anywhere else however, I am more known by my second name <b> “Catherine” </b>. I am currently in the last semester of my degree, Bachelor’s of Human Resources Management. I have been studying in RMIT for 3 and half years now, which in between I took a gap year. </p>

    <p> I have been living here in Australia for 5 years now. My background is Filipino with Spanish ancestors. However, I do not speak or know Spanish language more than the small list of terms that we have adapted to suit our day to day dialect in the Philippines. </p>

    <p>Interesting fact about me is I cannot drink coffee and I also play a fair amount of board games - few of my favourites are <strong> Catan, Carcassonne and King of Tokyo </strong>.</p>

    <h2>INTEREST IN I.T.</h2>

      <p> My interest in IT revolves around more on the general functionality side of it. I am more interested in how it helps perform the day to day tasks of non IT employees. 
I developed an interest in IT when I met my stepdad, he is a Solutions Architect in a global IT company that is based here in Melbourne. Whenever he talks about his job I could see there’s so much passion in his eyes which has inspired me and led me to studying Computer Science back in the Philippines. However, when I came here I developed more interest in business which is why I pursued my course now. 
 </p>

<p> By saying that, I also realised how IT has shaped and became part of our daily chores and activities in life. It is quite impossible to determine tasks we perform that do not involve IT. In business particularly in HR, IT is such an essential part of completing tasks efficiently. IT plays a large role in communication, storing and gathering data, as well as analysing it. HR is becoming more and more a consumer of IT. </p>

<p> This is why I enrolled in this course in hopes to have a better understanding of IT and be prepared for the future phase of the workplace. </p>

          <p> <a href="https://123psychology.com/personality-types-istj-isfj-estj-esfj/4/"> My Personality test result.</a> </p>

<p> From Myer and Briggs personality test, I achieved the result of being (EJST) <b> Extrovert </b>, <b> Sensor </b>, <b> Thinker </b> and a <b> Judger </b>. <br>
According to Myers and Briggs <b> ESTJs </b> in a nutshell are: <br>
<ul>
<li> naturals when it comes to organizing </li>

<li> level-headed, articulate and direct </li>  

<li> have strong personalities </li>

<li> Their life-philosophy could be described as: <i> What I show you, is what I am </i>. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I could never disagree to any of these. I am always described by some of my friends as someone of result-orientated, organized, social and have an outspoken opinion.<br>
I am the one who always organises any gatherings or outings we have, either with family or friends. I get really annoyed when someone else organises it and does not take not of the weather.<br>
And similarly, my life-philosophy is "<i>What you see,  is what you get </i>!" <br>
The test results accurately describes my personality.
</p> 
<p>
So, when forming a team, I will have to lay it out loud in clear with my team mates that this is how I am and I hope they would understand and see me as a good addition to the team.

<p> Your Scores: <br>
<ul>
<li> Auditory: 25% </li>
<li> Visual: 35% </li>
<li> <strong> Tactile: 40% </strong></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The result shows that I am classed as a <b> tactile </b> learner. This means that I learn by touching and doing. 
I understand and remember things through physical movement. 
I am also a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what I learn, and tends to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. <br>

When working in a team, I need to be active and take frequent breaks. I have observed this over the years, and I refure to take breaks I burn out or lose my focus. <br>
When I communicate and convey important information, I often speak with my hands and express my thoughts with the help of gestures.

<p> <strong> Working Style Test </strong> </p>

</p>

<p>
Business Chemistry has four pillars of working styles. These are:<b>Pioneer</b>, <b>Integrator</b>, <b>Driver</b> and <b>Guardian</b>. 
This test helps in developing a hunch about other people’s working styles through observation and also helps in identifying ways to engage more effectively with individuals and a team.</p>

<p>
My result from the test outlined that I am mostly <i> 49% </i> <b> Guardian </b> and <i> 40% </i> <b> Integrator </b>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Guardians</b> are you tend to be a planner, easily frustrated by people and things that waste their time, relationship-oriented, and realistic. They like concrete details and stability. Thye respect what is tried and true.<br>
Guardians are also the most introverted type. They view silence as a productive and important part of any conversation, as it gives them time to think before they speak and plan their words carefully.
</p>
<p>
Although I am highly aligned with the Guardian pattern, I differ from most Guardians in that I am rated as spontaneously generous, adaptable, and someone who appreciates colleagues with diverse skillsets. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Integrators</b> have two common sub-types. The <i>Teamer</i> is more externally focused and feels a strong sense of duty to society. The <i>Dreamer</i> is more inwardly focused and intrinsically motivated. <br>
I lean more towards as a <b>Teamer</b>.
</p>
<p>
And again, although I am highly aligned with the Integrator pattern, I differ from most Integrators in that I am easily frustrated by people and things that waste my time, I am also skeptical, and focused.
</p>
<p>
Understanding individual working styles in a team makes it easier in identifying strengths and assigning roles accordingly to it. It also helps in identofying the weaknesses in a team, makes it easier for them to outline the areas that requires improvement.
